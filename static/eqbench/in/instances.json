It's not like the world is going to end if your candidate doesn't win.\nLorelei: That's not the point, Harold. It's about what this election represents. It's about the future of our planet, our society.\nHarold: And you think your candidate has all the answers? \nLorelei: I believe they're at least trying to address the issues that matter. Climate change, social justice, healthcare...\nHarold: And you think throwing money at these issues will solve them?\nLorelei: It's not about throwing money, Harold. It's about investing in solutions, in our future.\nHarold: And who's going to pay for all these grand plans? Us, the taxpayers. \nLorelei: Isn't that the point of taxes? To fund public services and infrastructure?\nHarold: Yes, but there's a limit. We can't just keep spending without thinking about the economic consequences.\nLorelei: And we can't keep ignoring the environmental and social consequences of our actions either.\nHarold: I'm not suggesting we ignore them, Lorelei. I'm just saying we need to be realistic about what we can afford.\nLorelei: And I'm saying we can't afford not to act. The cost of inaction is far greater.\nHarold: And who decides what action is necessary? The government? The same government that can't even balance a budget?\nLorelei: We do, Harold. We, the people, decide through our votes.\nHarold: Well, we'll see what the people decide on election day, won't we?\nLorelei: Yes, we will. And I hope for all our sakes, they make the right decision.\nHarold: And what if they don't? What if they choose my candidate instead?\nLorelei: Then we'll have to live with the consequences, won't we?\nHarold: Yes, we will. And maybe then you'll see that the world doesn't end just because your candidate didn't win.\nLorelei: And maybe you'll see that some things are more important than a balanced budget.\nHarold: Maybe.

What if that's what it takes to light up the path?\nAndrew: You're not just risking your own future, Sonya. There are employees, investors, stakeholders involved.\nSonya: I'm well aware of that, Andrew. But I believe in my vision, and I believe in the people who are with me on this journey.\nAndrew: It's not about belief, Sonya. It's about strategy, it's about calculated moves.\nSonya: Strategy without belief is a ship without a compass, Andrew. It might keep you afloat, but it won't get you anywhere.\nAndrew: And belief without strategy is a ship without a rudder. You'll be lost at sea.\nSonya: Maybe, but at least I'll be sailing, not stuck in the harbor.\nAndrew: Sonya, you need to listen. This isn't a game. This is real life, real money, real people.\nSonya: And real innovation, Andrew. Real change. That's what I'm after. Not just money.\nAndrew: You're naive, Sonya. You're letting your passion cloud your judgment.\nSonya: And you're letting your fear cloud yours, Andrew.\nAndrew: This isn't about fear, Sonya. This is about wisdom, about experience.\nSonya: And maybe that's the problem, Andrew. Maybe your experience is blinding you to new possibilities.\nAndrew: And maybe your inexperience is blinding you to the realities of this business.\nSonya: Then maybe it's time for a new reality, Andrew. One that isn't defined by fear and caution.\nAndrew: Sonya, I'm trying to help you here.\nSonya: And I appreciate that, Andrew. But I won't compromise my vision. I won't let fear dictate our path.\nAndrew: Sonya, you need to...\nSonya: No, Andrew. I don't need to do anything. This is my company, my vision. If you can't see that, then maybe this partnership isn't going to work.\nAndrew: Sonya, don't be foolish.

Isn't that what you want?\nRafael: I want art to be human. I want it to be raw, emotional, unpredictable.
