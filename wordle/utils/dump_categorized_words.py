    This classification is based on the assumption that the frequency distribution is normal
    However most of the words are in the medium category and no words are in the low category

    Since clemgame analysis is not based on the frequency categorization, keeping the classification as is

    For future work:
    1. The classification can be improved by using a different method to classify the frequencies
    2. Use a different frequency distribution file
    3. The word may be complex depending on the letters used in the word [complex word with simple letters, simple word with complex letters, etc.]
